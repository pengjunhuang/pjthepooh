Summary: 


I was born in [Guangzhou, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou) and like hundreds of ordinary Chinese families in Canton area, my family moved to U.S. when I was a high school senior.

Have been a stats geek ever since I got a book by my teacher as a farewell gift called “What is a p-value anyway?”. After graduating from UCLA, I have been working as a data scientist in Silicon Valley, I’m enthusiastic about statistics, machine learning, and big data technologies, with experiences in various fields including marketplace dynamic, finance, fraud and etc. I’m actively looking for opportunities where my expertise can be applied.

I’m active in many kinds of sports such as basketball, swimming and snowboarding. I also love hiking and traveling. Summer and beach are always my good friends.
