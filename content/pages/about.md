Summary: 

My name is PJ, born and raised in [Guangzhou, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou). I'm currently a [data scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) in [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley), immersing myself in a world of science and new technology. I truly believe that most great decisions are driven by data. I'm willing to learn as much as I can to become a full-stack data scientist.

I love sports such as swimming, basketball, snowboarding and bicycling. To be a better version of myself, I love to travel! My another big interest is teaching. I believe that sharing knowledge takes a key role in human society.

As a first-generation immigrant in U.S., I would love to contribute my little effort to help the [Chinese immigrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Chinese_Americans) community.

I speak Cantonese, Mandarin and English.
