Summary:


Recently several of my friends asked me for tips on Japan because they have planed or are going to plan their first Japan trip, like I did half a year ago. My girlfriend outlined our trip previously so I decided to share it.

# Introduction

Late March of 2016, we went to Japan for the first time. PJ had always wanted to visit Japan, and was even tempted to study the language. We were able to make one of these wishes come true. We stayed in Japan for about 2 weeks, and visited 7 cities. Before the trip we did a lot of research and compiled a detailed plan. This was the first time we have traveled together to a country where neither of us spoke the language. After this unforgettable trip, we decided to share our experience and tips we have collected throughout our trip in this foreign country.

# Cherry Blossoms

Coincidentally, we planned our trip during Spring Break, just in time to see the amazing cherry blossoms bloom in Japan. This iconic flower only blooms for a short period of time, that varies between a 1-2 months period (usually late March to early April) across Japan. If you would like to see the beautiful sight of roads lined with cherry blossoms, be sure to do your homework and check approximately when these pretty flowers will bloom in the area you are visiting. The exact dates varies every year, but the overall pattern is relatively correct. Blooming was later than expected this year, but we got to see the breathtaking sight of cherry blossoms on our last day in Japan, in Ueno Park in Tokyo.

# Osaka
Our first stop was Osaka. A must-see sight in Osaka is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Osaka Castle</span>. At this well-known castle, we were able to learn about the history behind the castle and see a slight glimpse into the historical culture of Japan. The castle is surrounded by a moat and the Osaka Castle Park that is home to many cherry blossom trees. The observation deck inside the castle is a great place to see the park.

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dotonbori</span> is the place to go for the Times Square-esque light ads. This is where the Glico running man advertisement is. Try to go at night to see the light ads against the dark sky, and walk amongst the crowd of people to either eat lots of great Japanese food or shop around the night market.

# Kyoto
From Osaka, we rode the Shinkansen for 0.5 - 1 hour and arrived at Kyoto Station. Walk out of the station, and you will be greeted by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kyoto Tower</span>. Kyoto Tower is the tallest building in Kyoto. We suggest you view the tower at night, to see the red tower contrast against the night sky.

&nbsp;

Kyoto, being the old capitol of Japan, is filled with shrines and temples. Many tourist would visit Kinkakuji Golden Temple. However, we only had one day in Kyoto and the Golden Temple was too far north. In the end, we decided to go to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine</span>. This shrine has pathways lined with thousands of tori gates that loops around the back mountain.

# Hakone

The next stop in our adventure was Hakone, to see the famous Fuji Mountain. Deviating from our Airbnb living accommodations, we decided to stay at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hotel Green Plaza Hakone</span>. This hotel has an onsen with an amazing view of Fuji Mountain. The first day we arrived, the fog was too thick for us to see anything. Fortunately, the next morning the fog disappeared, allowing us to see the magnificent view. The view made the hotel price and the transportation hassle (subway -&gt; train -&gt; bus -&gt; gondola) worth it.

Traditional Japanese onsens are separated by men and women baths, and require all bathers to be nude. There are proper steps to using onsens, and specific rules. Be sure to review onsen etiquette before going to one.

# Tokyo
Our fourth destination, was the busy city of Tokyo. Tokyo is a anime and manga lover's dream. Strolling around Akihabara, our childhood self was jumping with joy. The streets were lined with shops selling figurines and items from Slam Dunk to Dragonball Z to Sailor Moon, and much much more. Tokyo Station and Shibuya allowed us to see the bustling culture of Japan.

A must-see building in Tokyo is the Tokyo Tower. The observation deck of Tokyo Tower provides you with a 360° view of the city. However, we wanted to see the Tokyo Tower from afar. To do this, we walked to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">World Trade Center Observatory</span>. We LOVED this location and the view we were able to see.

&nbsp;

On the day of our 6th year anniversary, we wanted to step away from the business of Tokyo, and took a quick train ride to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odaiba</span>, an artificial island a bridge away from Tokyo. From the Decks Odaiba, we looked back at the busy heart of Tokyo and saw the buildings and the Rainbow Bridge. A short walk down the boardwalk will lead you to Diver City Plaza, home to a giant Gundam figure.

&nbsp;

At <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ueno Park</span> our line of sight was filled with cherry blossoms no matter where we went. We went on a Sunday; the park floors were covered with people picnicking under the trees. The cherry blossoms, the people, the music and decorations made this an remarkable memory.

# Yokohama
An hour Shinkansen train ride away from Tokyo, is the quitter city of Yokohama. Along the pier are many interesting sites, such as the Yokohama Brick Warehouse (a warehouse turned into a shopping center), a shopping mall, and ferris wheel.

We also visited the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cup Noodles Museum</span> and learned about the history of Japanese cup noodles. Let your imagination and food-lover side run wide, and DIY customize your own cup noodles. We were on a tight schedule and could not wait through the long lines.

# Atami - Izu

The last stretch of our trip was Atami and Izu Pennizula. During this last stretch, we stepped away from the bustling city life and reconnected with more nature locations. Right outside of the Atami Station is a feet hotspring, open to the public. At Atami, we ate some cheap but amazingly fresh sushi and sashimi.

&nbsp;

From Atami, we hopped on a train for 1 hour and arrived in Ito. At Ito, we walked along the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jogasaki Coast</span>, feeling the strong winds and hearing the loud waves. Down the coast is the Kadowaki Bridge, where our childish side took over and we started running down the bridge while the winds blew at our faces.

&nbsp;

After walking along the coast, we rode a local bus to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Izu Granpal Park</span>. Luckily, there was a lightshow at the park, and we had time to spare. There were lights everywhere, including multiple light models of dolphins :) The light tunnel slide was so much fun, and got us hyped up for watching the rest of the lights. Each section of the park had a different theme and had captivating lightshows.

# Conclusion
All in all, this was an extraordinary trip. The sights, the food, the culture, the childhood memories, allowed us to understand this interesting country. With this trip under our belt, we are able to take on more adventure, and tackle more countries where we do not know the language. Until the next journey!

Hope you find something useful here.
