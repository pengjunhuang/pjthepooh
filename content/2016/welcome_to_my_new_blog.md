Summary:


## What is PJ the Pooh?
This is my nickname created by my wife. This is just my personal page to record my life and share my passion. It is not a pure tech blog.

## My old habit
Time flies. Last time I blogged was when I was in middle school, which is about a decade ago, when Weibo, Facebook and Twitter did not even exist. I was blogging pretty consistently because it helped calm me down as I was in my teenage rebellion period. Of course, the content was mostly about my little things in life and nothing worthy to read if you didn't know me. More importantly, it reminded me of my old stories reading it years later. All the images and feelings would emerge whenever I read it again. My life has changed since my family and I moved to U.S, and then I stopped this habit.

## Why would I blog again?
Why not? Besides the main reason of simply wanting a space for myself, I have the following reasons why I want to do this.

**My own space** - I have full control of this space, from the server to my words.

**Stays in touch** -  Mainly to stay in touch with family and friends who I can't see very often.

**Gain knowledge** - Updating blog regularly is a perfect way to stay tuned with the events in my fields.

**Share knowledge** - It may help others who search for similar topics.

**Store my stuff** - It would be convenient to find my own stuff in one place.

**To practice my writing** - I am a terrible writer so here I come.

**To connect with like-minded people** - Hopefully!

Anyway, welcome and please keep in touch!</p>
